If Command is usually available in 3 forms : 
    
    1) Simple If
    2) If-Else 
    3) Else-If 

1) Simple If :  

    if [ expression ]; then
            commands
    fi 

    Command are going to be executed only if the expression is true. 

* What will happen if the expression fails ? Simple, commands won't be executed.

        command 1 

    else 

        command 2

    fi

3) Else-If

        command 1 

    elif [ expression2 ] ; then 

        command 2 
    
    elif [ expression3 ] ; then
